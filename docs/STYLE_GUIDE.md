# PROBE Style Guide
> **Version:** v1.6 (2026-05-19) · **Scope:** All files under `scouting/` and `analysis/`
> This document is the single source of truth for formatting rules.
> Agent reads this file before producing any output. Never modify output format without updating this guide first.

---

## 1. Output File Convention

The scouting routine runs **twice a week (Monday & Thursday)**, once per
pillar. Each run produces **one Korean file**:

| File | Language | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `scouting/YYYY-MM-DD-P#.md` | Korean | The scouting report. `YYYY-MM-DD` is the run date; `P#` is the pillar (P1–P4). Used by the agent for de-duplication and future retrieval. |

The report is written directly in Korean (no separate English file).
Paper titles, arXiv links, and `P#/D#/CP#` tags stay verbatim in their
original form (see §4-1), so de-duplication across previous reports
works on those verbatim tokens regardless of prose language.

---

## 2. Emoji System

Emojis are used **only on section and subsection headers** (lines starting with `##` or `###`).
They are **never** used inside body text, bullet points, table cells, or code blocks.

### 2-1. Section-level (`##`) Emojis

| Emoji | Section |
|-------|---------|
| 🔑 | Reference Legend |
| 📋 | Scout Methodology |
| 🥇 | Paper N — PRIORITY ★★★ |
| 🥈 | Paper N — PRIORITY ★★ |
| 🥉 | Paper N — PRIORITY ★ |
| 🌱 | Paper N — CROSS-POLLINATION |
| 📊 | Scoring Summary |
| 🚫 | Candidate Papers That Did Not Pass Filter |
| 💡 | Context Suggestions |
| 🔄 | Run-over-Run Synthesis |

### 2-2. Subsection-level (`###`) Emojis

These four emojis are used consistently across **all** paper entries:

| Emoji | Subsection |
|-------|------------|
| 🎯 | (a) P# / D# touched |
| ✨ | (b) What is genuinely new |
| ⚙️ | (c) Decision implication |
| ⚠️ | (d) Failure mode to probe first |

Context Suggestions subsections use a single emoji:

| Emoji | Subsection |
|-------|------------|
| 📌 | All sub-sections within Context Suggestions |

### 2-3. Rules

- One emoji per header, placed at the **start** of the header text, after `##` or `###` and a space.
- Do not add emojis to the report title (`#`) or to table headers.
- Do not use any emoji not listed in this guide.
- Emojis are not translated — use the symbols exactly as listed.

#### Correct example
```markdown
## 🥇 Paper 1 — PRIORITY ★★★
### 🎯 (a) P# / D# touched
### ✨ (b) What is genuinely new
```

#### Incorrect example
```markdown
## Paper 1 — PRIORITY ★★★ 🥇              ← emoji at end, wrong
### (a) 🎯 P# / D# touched                  ← emoji inside text, wrong
The policy achieved ✨ great results.       ← emoji in body text, wrong
```

## 3. Link Format Rule

Every paper entry must include a direct link. Precedence:

1. arXiv preprint → `[arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX)`
2. DOI / proceedings → `[DOI](https://doi.org/...)`
3. Neither available → `[no public link]`

Links must appear:
- In the paper header (immediately below the bold title)
- In the Scoring Summary table (`Link` column)
- In the Candidate Papers table (`Link` column)
- Inline in Context Suggestions when an arXiv ID is mentioned

Do not fabricate arXiv IDs. Verify that the URL resolves before including it.

### 3-1. Reference Legend & cross-reference links

The report opens with a **Reference Legend** — a one-line glossary of the
`P#` / `D#` / `CP#` codes, so a reader who does not have the codes
memorized can decode the report without opening `context/P#.md`.

**Scope.** Only `P#` (Pillar), `D#` (Decision), `CP#` (Checkpoint) codes.
**Only codes actually cited in this report.** Never list a code the body
does not use; never list competitor codenames, Identity, or the falsifier.

**Placement.** A single `## 🔑 Reference Legend` section, immediately
after the top intro blockquote and immediately before `## 📋 Scout
Methodology`. It is the first content section of the report.

**Format.** One compact table, rows ordered `P#` → `D#` (ascending) →
`CP#` (ascending), one row per distinct cited code:

```markdown
## 🔑 Reference Legend

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| <a id="ref-P1"></a>**P1** | Heterogeneous Body/Hand Action Expert (pillar) |
| <a id="ref-D4"></a>**D4** | Body↔Hand information sharing — v1 FiLM; cross-attn/hidden-state deferred |
| <a id="ref-CP1"></a>**CP1** | Checkpoint 1: v1 first ablation (4-contribution, in-hand rotation, sim) |
```

If the body cites no such code (rare), omit the section entirely.

**Meaning source** (deterministic — derive from `context/P#.md`,
which the agent already reads; do not invent):

| Code | Source in `context/P#.md` | Meaning string |
|------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| `P#` | §2 heading `Pillar P# — <name>` | `<name>` + `(pillar)` |
| `D#` | §4 `#### [D#] <title>` + its v1 line | `<title>` — v1 choice in ≤ ~12 words |
| `CP#` | §3 bullet `- **CP#**: <desc>` | `Checkpoint #: <desc>` (compressed) |

**Anchor convention.** Each legend row carries an explicit HTML anchor
`<a id="ref-<CODE>"></a>` placed before the bold code. `<CODE>` is the
verbatim code (`P1`, `D4`, `CP2` — case preserved; GitHub matches explicit
`id=` attributes verbatim).

**In-body links (first occurrence per section).** Within each top-level
`##` section (each Paper N, 📋, 📊, 🚫, 💡, 🔄), the **first** textual
occurrence of each distinct code is written as `[D4](#ref-D4)`. Later
occurrences of that same code **in the same section** stay plain text.
Each new `##` section links the first occurrence again, so any section is
self-contained for jump-back. Codes inside table cells and code blocks are
not linked. The legend rows themselves are not self-linked.

## 4. Korean Authoring Principles

The report is written directly in Korean. There is no English source
file to translate from — but the same rules apply for which tokens stay
verbatim in their original form versus which prose is Korean.

### 4-1. What to write in Korean vs. keep verbatim

| Category | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Body prose | Korean (formal 합니다/됩니다 체) |
| Paper titles | Keep original English title; add Korean description if helpful |
| Technical terms | First occurrence: Korean term + English in parentheses. Subsequent: Korean only |
| Config / code names | Keep verbatim (`env_cfg.py`, `ObservationManager`, etc.) |
| Formulas / numbers | Keep verbatim (`ε = 0.1`, `±2σ`, `< 15%`, etc.) |
| P#, D#, CP# tags | Keep verbatim (`P2`, `D11`, `CP3`, etc.) |
| Reference Legend | Meaning column in Korean; codes + `<a id="ref-…">` anchors verbatim |
| Anchor / intra-doc links | Keep `id=` and `[…](#ref-…)` verbatim — links resolve within the file |
| arXiv links | Keep verbatim |
| Emojis | Keep identical — same position, same emoji |
| Section headers | Korean header text (see §4-3); keep emoji prefix |

### 4-2. Technical term glossary (standard translations)

| English | Korean |

| ⚠️ (d) Failure mode to probe first | ⚠️ (d) 먼저 검증해야 할 실패 모드 |
| 📌 (sub-sections) | 📌 (하위 섹션) |

### 4-4. Tone and style

- Use formal Korean (합니다/됩니다 체).
- Maintain full analytical density — do not simplify or summarize away detail.
- Use bold (`**text**`) for emphasis where it aids the reader.
- Code blocks and inline code (`` `text` ``) are kept verbatim.

---

## 5. Paper Analysis Document (`analysis/`)

The `/analyze-paper` slash command (prompt: `.claude/prompts/paper-analysis.md`)
produces a deep-dive on **one** paper at `analysis/<arxiv-id>.md`.

### 5-1. File convention

- **Korean single document.** Like every other PROBE output, a paper
  analysis is a single Korean document — there is no English source
  file. It is written natively in Korean per §4 (tone, glossary,
  verbatim tokens), not translated. The filename carries no language
  suffix — every PROBE output is Korean, so marking it is redundant.
- Filename: `analysis/<arxiv-id>.md` (e.g. `analysis/2401.12345.md`);
  non-arXiv PDF input uses a human-chosen slug.
- Regenerable snapshot — re-running overwrites the file, never appends.
- The document follows `analysis/_TEMPLATE.md` exactly: part (A) a
  neutral structured summary, part (B) `context/MASTER.md`-anchored
  decision-grade implications.

### 5-2. Emoji system

Same rule as §2: one emoji at the **start** of each `##` / `###`
header, never in body text. Section (`##`) emojis for this document
type — these are the only emojis permitted here in addition to §2:

| Emoji | Section | Part |
|-------|---------|------|
| 📄 | 논문 메타 | A |
| 🧭 | 한 줄 요약 (TL;DR) | A |
| ❓ | 문제 정의 / 동기 | A |
| 🧩 | 핵심 기여 | A |
| 🔬 | 방법론 | A |
| 📊 | 실험 설정과 결과 | A |
| ⚖️ | 한계 | A |
| ♻️ | 재현성 | A |
| 🎯 | 관련 Pillar / Decision (P# / D#) | B |
| ✨ | 핀 논문 대비 델타 | B |
| ⚙️ | 의사결정 함의 | B |
| ⚠️ | 먼저 검증할 실패 모드 | B |
| 💡 | 컨텍스트 제안 | B |

Part (B) reuses the existing 🎯 ✨ ⚙️ ⚠️ 💡 semantics from §2-2 / §2-1.
Do not use any emoji not listed in §2 or here.

### 5-3. Korean & verbatim rules

§4 applies in full. Specifically: original English paper title,
config/code names, formulas, arXiv links, and `P#`/`D#`/`CP#` tags
are kept verbatim; technical terms use the §4-2 glossary; tone is
formal 합니다/됩니다 체.

### 5-4. Body-acquisition honesty

The 📄 메타 header MUST state the actual full-text level reached
(`전문(arXiv HTML)` / `전문(ar5iv)` / `PDF 텍스트(pdftotext)` /
`초록 only`). If only the abstract was obtained, every part (B)
section is prefixed **(본문 미확보 — 잠정)**. Failed `curl` calls are
recorded verbatim (command + HTTP status); fabricated content is never
substituted.
